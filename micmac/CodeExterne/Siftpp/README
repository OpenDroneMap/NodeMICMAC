COPYRIGHT WARNING

  This code implements an algorithm (SIFT) patented by David Lowe and
  cannot be used for commercial purposes without his permission. See
  the included license notice for more information.


INSTALLING

  If you downloaded the binary distribution, binaries for Mac OS X PPC,
  Mac OS X Intel and GNU/Linux are found in the mci, mac and glx
  sub-directories.

  In most cases the program can be compiled by typing

  > make

  from the command line. The Makefile attempts to auto-configure a few
  parameters. If this fails, the Makefile returns with an error.  This
  DOES NOT mean that SIFT++ cannot be complied successfully. The
  program can still be complied by hand, or by modifying the Makefile.

USAGE

  See the included man page (man ./sift.1), also available in HTML
  format if you downloaded the binary distribution (sift.html).

CHANGES
  0.8.1  Compiles under Ubuntu 64.
  0.8.0  Better Makefile.
  0.7.3  Another bug fix introduced in 0.7.1.
  0.7.2  Fixed a bug introduced with 0.7.1.
  0.7.1  Tuned a few parameters to better match D. Lowe.
  0.7.0  --unnormalized, --floating-point, --magnif
         Bug fixes (thanks to Brian).
  0.6.7  Bug fixes (thanks to Loic).
  0.6.6  Bug fixes (thanks to Giuseppe).
  0.6.5  Bug fixes (thanks to Liu).
  0.6.4  Added -I. to Makefile.
  0.6.3  Minor bug fixes (thanks to Erwin).
  0.6.2  Minor bug fixes. Minor corrections to the man page.
  0.6.1  Removed a bug affecting the downsampling of oddly sized images.
  0.6.0  Introduced --stable-order option.
  0.5.6  Fixed a minor bug in the convolution code. Increased the default
         number of octaves that get computed.
  0.5.5  More bug fixes (PGM parsing error)
  0.5.4  New switch VL_LOWE_STRICT. This enables features that simulate
         even more closely Lowe's implementation (it does even
         simulate a small 'bug').
  0.5.3  Bug fixes (thanks to P. Ivanov).
  0.5.2  Man page.
  0.5.1  Changed the way image boundaries are handled in the computation
         of the scalespace (thanks to Q.S.Luo for indicating the
         problem). This makes the algorithm even closer to
         Lowe's. Inital version of the manpage.
  0.5    Optionally reads keypoint frames from file. Improved interface.
  0.4    Faster (and approximated) computations. Binary descriptor output.
  0.3    Added `--threshold' and `--edge-threshold' opitons to the
         command line driver.
  0.2.2  Corrected a bug in the resolution of the 3x3 linear system.
         (thanks to Fan Gu for finding this out)
  0.2.1  Corrected a bug in the command line driver.
  0.2    Made LAPACK independent.
  0.1    Initial version.

\section{Random number}

\PPP use some pseudo random generator. As every such generator
they must be initialized with a seed.
By default , the seed is always the same to facilitate debuging.
When user wants initialization from time this must be specified 
with a negative value of parameter {\tt  SeedRand}.



\section{Enum to string}

The enum/string  conversion is a recurent problem of \CPP which
as far as I know is still an issue. A possible solution
would be to use some code genration which from easy to read
an write text file woul generate it. But I tried to limitate
the code generation in \PPP.

In file {\tt Serial/uti\_e2string.cpp} is implemanted 
the used solution , it consist  to create data for each enum
for which we want to do the conversion {\tt Serial/uti\_e2string.cpp}.
